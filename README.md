CARVO, Crowd Voting, is a transformative software solution designed to optimize and modernize political systems. The current challenges faced by governments include dispersed citizen participation and opaque decision-making processes. CARVO addresses these issues systematically by incorporating modules for user management, real-time voter preference understanding, governmental assistants, AI-enhanced project management, decision-making, and project funding.

The identified gap in existing solutions underscores the need for a comprehensive platform tailored to the specific requirements of political bodies. CARVO aims to increase user involvement, ensure transparent procedures, and facilitate better decision-making. Its significance lies in its potential to promote a more responsible, efficient, and inclusive political system, benefiting both citizens and political leaders.
